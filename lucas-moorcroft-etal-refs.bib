	Abstract = {Analyses of life-history, ecological, and geographic trait differences among species, their causes, correlates, and likely consequences are increasingly important for understanding and conserving biodiversity in the face of rapid global change. Assembling multispecies trait data from diverse literature sources into a single comprehensive data set requires detailed consideration of methods to reliably compile data for particular species, and to derive single estimates from multiple sources based on different techniques and definitions. Here we describe PanTHERIA, a species-level data set compiled for analysis of life history, ecology, and geography of all known extant and recently extinct mammals. PanTHERIA is derived from a database capable of holding multiple geo-referenced values for variables within a species containing 100?740 lines of biological data for extant and recently extinct mammalian species, collected over a period of three years by 20 individuals. PanTHERIA also includes spatial databases of mammalian geographic ranges and global climatic and anthropogenic variables. Here we detail how the data fields are extracted and defined for PanTHERIA using a customized data input format (MammalForm); how data were collected from the literature, species names and sources tracked, error-checking and validation procedures applied, and how data were consolidated into species-level values for each variable. Tables of the consolidated species-level values are made available for each of two recent species-level taxonomic classifications of mammals, as well as associated taxonomic synonymy conversion and data-input files. This study provides a useful guide to prospective researchers on how to structure and codify life-history, ecological, geographic, and taxonomic data and methods to extract meaningful species-level traits. It also provides comprehensive information on traits like size, diet, environmental conditions, and ecology to permit macroecological and macroevolutionary analyses of this important clade. The complete data sets corresponding to abstracts published in the Data Papers section of the journal are published electronically in Ecological Archives at ?http://esapubs.org/archive?. (The accession number for each Data Paper is given directly beneath the title.)},

(1999) Present An Updated "Qualitative" Method For Identifying Species From Their Echolocation Calls. However, They Make The Assumption That, Like Bird Songs, Echolocation Calls Of Bats Are Species-Specific. There Is No Reason To Expect That Natural Selection Favored Incorporation Of This Information. Although Identification Of Some Species Of Bats By Their Calls Is Possible, Variation At Several Levels Makes Other Species Indistinguishable. Monitoring Echolocation In The Field And Identifying Species Can Be Useful In Determining Presence Or Absence Of Species And Factors Influencing Activity Of Bats. However, Limitations And Degree Of Reliability Of The Technique Must Be Recognized. Only By More Explicitly Defining How The Method Is Used And Quantifying Characteristics That Define Calls Of Recognizable Species Will The Method Be Scientifically Sound And Repeatable. I Suggest A Number Of Guidelines For Use Of The Method In Field Studies.},

@article{Zhao_2011,
	Abstract = {A Lack Of Reliable Observations For Canopy Science Research Is Being
   Partly Overcome By The Gradual Use Of Lidar Remote Sensing. This Study
   Aims To Improve Lidar-Based Canopy Characterization With Airborne Laser
   Scanners Through The Combined Use Of Lidar Composite Metrics And Machine
   Learning Models. Our So-Called Composite Metrics Comprise A Relatively
   Large Number Of Lidar Predictors That Tend To Retain As Much Information
   As Possible When Reducing Raw Lidar Point Clouds Into A Format Suitable
   As Inputs To Predictive Models Of Canopy Structural Variables. The
   Information-Rich Property Of Such Composite Metrics Is Further
   Complemented By Machine Learning, Which Offers An Array Of Supervised
   Learning Models Capable Of Relating Canopy Characteristics To
   High-Dimensional Lidar Metrics Via Complex, Potentially Nonlinear
   Functional Relationships. Using Coincident Lidar And Field Data Over An
   Eastern Texas Forest In Usa, We Conducted A Case Study To Demonstrate
   The Ubiquitous Power Of The Lidar Composite Metrics In Predicting
   Multiple Forest Attributes And Also Illustrated The Use Of Two Kernel
   Machines, Namely, Support Vector Machine And Gaussian Processes (Gp).
   Results Show That The Two Machine Learning Models In Conjunction With
   The Lidar Composite Metrics Outperformed Traditional Approaches Such As
   The Maximum Likelihood Classifier And Linear Regression Models. For
   Example, The Five-Fold Cross Validation For Gp Regression Models (Vs.
   Linear/Log-Linear Models) Yielded A Root Mean Squared Error Of 1.06
   (2.36) M For Lorey's Height, 0.95 (3.43) M For Dominant Height, 534
   (8.51) M(2)/Ha For Basal Area, 21.4 (40.5) Mg/Ha For Aboveground
   Biomass, 654 (9.88) Mg/Ha For Belowground Biomass, 0.75 (2.76) M For
   Canopy Base Height, 2.2 (2.76) M For Canopy Ceiling Height, 0.015 (0.02)
   Kg/M(3) For Canopy Bulk Density, 0.068 (0.133) Kg/M(2) For Available
   Canopy Fuel, And 033 (0.39) M(2)/M(2) For Leaf Area Index. Moreover,
   Uncertainty Estimates From The Gp Regression Were More Indicative Of The
   True Errors In The Predicted Canopy Variables Than Those From Their
   Linear Counterparts. With The Ever-Increasing Accessibility Of
   Multisource Remote Sensing Data, We Envision A Concomitant Expansion In
   The Use Of Advanced Statistical Methods, Such As Machine Learning, To
   Explore The Potentially Complex Relationships Between Canopy
   Characteristics And Remotely-Sensed Predictors, Accompanied By A
   Desideratum For Improved Error Analysis. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All

	Abstract = {{The transmission of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax malaria
   in a mixed population of Thais and migrant Burmese living along the
   Thai-Myanmar border is studied through a mathematical model. The
   population is separated into two groups: Thai and Burmese. Each
   population in turn is divided into susceptible, infected, recovered and
   in case of vivax infection, a dormant subclass. The model is then
   modified to allow for some of the Burmese (given as a fraction P) to be
   infectious when they enter into Thailand. The behaviour of the modified
   model is obtained using a standard dynamical analysis. A new basic
   reproduction number is obtained. Numerical simulations of the modified
   model show that when P not equal 0 and the same set of parameter values
   used in the initial model are used, the Thai population will be in the
   epidemic state. In other words, the repeated introduction of infectious
   Burmese (no matter how small of a number) will result in a malaria
   epidemic among the Thais irregardless of the public health practice
   undertaken by the Thai government. In the presence of the infected
   Burmese, the Thai government would have to increase the facilitites to
   treat the people who are infected by the malaria.}},

@article{thomas1983annual,
	Abstract = {
The seasonal movements of Eidolon helvum, Myonycteris torquata, and Nanonycteris veldkampi were studied over a 2-year period in West Africa. During the dry season, E. helvum roosts in at least one large colony (ca. 500 000 individuals) in the southern forest zone of Ivory Coast. Following the birth of young in February, males and females move into the savanna zones, and the progressive establishment and decline of colonies along a south--north axis indicates that E. helvum migrates at least to the Niger River basin by the middle of the wet season (July). During the dry season, both M. torquata and N. veldkampi are absent from savanna sites, but are common in the forest zone. With the onset of the rainy season in March, catch rates of both species increase first at a southern Guinea savanna site and subsequently at a savanna site 400 km to the north, indicating that both species migrate at least to the southern Sudanese savanna zone during the wet season. Both sexes of N. veldkampi migrate, but the migration of M. torquata is restricted to the immature male cohorts. I argue that the high amplitude of the seasonal fluctuations in fruit abundance at savanna sites creates a wet-season surplus of food which results in low intra- and inter-specific competition levels at these sites relative to the forest zone. This may provide the conditions leading to the observed annual migrations.

@article{Bono17102012,
	Abstract = {Competition for resources has long been viewed as a key agent of divergent selection. Theory holds that populations facing severe intraspecific competition will tend to use a wider range of resources, possibly even using entirely novel resources that are less in demand. Yet, there have been few experimental tests of these ideas. Using the bacterial virus (bacteriophage) ϕ6 as a model system, we examined whether competition for host resources promotes the evolution of novel resource use. In the laboratory, ϕ6 exhibits a narrow host range but readily produces mutants capable of infecting novel bacterial hosts. Here, we show that when ϕ6 populations were subjected to intense intraspecific competition for their standard laboratory host, they rapidly evolved new generalist morphs that infect novel hosts. Our results therefore suggest that competition for host resources may drive the evolution of host range expansion in viruses. More generally, our findings demonstrate that intraspecific resource competition can indeed promote the evolution of novel resource-use phenotypes.},
