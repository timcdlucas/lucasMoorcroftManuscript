\section{Abstract}
\subsection*{1:}  Wildlife monitoring technology has advanced rapidly and the use of remote sensors such as camera traps, and acoustic detectors is becoming common in both the terrestrial and marine environments. Current capture recapture or distance methods require individual recognition of animals or knowing the distance of the animal from the sensor, which is often difficult. Current methods require either individual identification in order to apply capture recapture analysis, or mobile sensors and static animals together with known distance between animal and sensor on detection in order to apply distance analysis. A method without these requirements, the random encounter model (REM), has been successfully applied to estimate animal densities from count data generated from camera traps. However, count data from acoustic detectors do not fit the assumptions of the REM model due to the directionality of animal calls.

\subsection*{2:} We developed a generalised REM model (gREM) to estimate animal density from count data from both camera traps and acoustic detectors. We tested the validity of this model using simulations of different survey lengths, sensor detection angles, call directionality, animal speeds and animal densities. We have then tested the robustness of the gREM by simulating a sensor survey of an animal population moving through space. From these surveys we estimated animal density using our new models and compared this to the known input density of animals to test the validity of the new models.

\subsection*{3:} We find that the gREM model produces unbiased estimates of animal density but the precision of the estimate increases with the number of captures. Higher capture numbers can be achieved with longer surveys, wider sensor detection zones, lower call directionality, faster animal speeds and higher animal densities. Our simulations suggest that at least 100 captures is necessary for high estimate precision. %The new models can be used to estimate animal density from surveys with any combination of sensor detection angle and call directionality. We find that the models give an unbiased estimate of density. The precision of the estimate increases the number of captures during the survey which is influenced by including detection zone and length of survey, the speed and density of animal. We found that for highly precise estimates at least 100 number of captures is necessary.

\subsection*{4:} We conclude that the gREM model provides an effective method to estimate animal densities from remote sensor count data controlling for detectability. As sensors such as camera traps and acoustic detectors become more ubiquitous, this model will be increasingly useful for monitoring animal populations across broad spatial, temporal and taxonomic scales.  %We conclude that these models provide an effective method to estimate animal density from sensor count data. We anticipate that surveys of acoustically detected species, or camera trap surveys, which before could only give relative metrics of population size will now be able to estimate population density controlling for detectability.   As sensors such as camera traps and acoustic detectors become cheaper and more practical these models will be increasingly useful for monitoring animal populations across broad spatial, temporal or taxonomic scales.

\section{Introduction}

Animal population size is one of the fundamental measures needed in ecology and conservation. The absolute size of a population has important implications for a range of issues such as genetic diversity \citep{o1985genetic, fischer2000genetic, willi2005threefold}, sensitivity to stochastic fluctuations \citep{richter1972extinction,wright1983stochastic} and risk of extinction \citep{purvis2000predicting}. However, many authors highlight the need to consider detectability when estimating density, since failure to do so will usually give biased results. In particular, this bias has been highlighted as a problem for the interpretation of count rates from sensors such as camera traps \citep{jennelle2002use, foster2012critique}.

The methods for sampling populations are varied. Traditionally, human surveyors collecting data were the primary method, but sensor technology, such as camera traps \citep{rowcliffe2008surveys,ahumada2011community} and acoustic detectors \citep{ofarrel1999comparison,mellinger2007fixed,jones2011indicator} are becoming increasingly used to survey animal populations.  Sensors are growing in popularity, as they are efficient, relativity cheap and non-invasive \citep{gese2001monitoring, o2003crouching, silveira2003camera}. With respect to efficiency, the use of autonomous sensors allows for surveys over large areas and long periods. 

Some species are much more easily detected or identified by acoustic detectors. For example, while bat identification by hand requires much training, methods are being developed to automatically identify species from their calls \citep{Adams_2010,walters_2012}. With respect to distance (or the radius of detection), large Cetaceans are loud enough to detected from tens of kilometres away, further than is possible visually \citep{clark1995application, mcdonald2004difar,barlow2005estimates}.  


However, the problem of converting sampled count data to estimates of density remains. The preferred method for estimating density if individuals can be recognised is capture-recapture e.g. \citep{karanth1995, trolle2003estimation, soisalo2006estimating, trolle2007camera}. If individual recognition is impossible but the distance between animal and sensor can be estimated, distance sampling methods can be used to estimate density, although these often ignore animal movement which may bias estimates \citep{barlow2005estimates, marques2011estimating}. Finally, methods for density estimation, based on ideal gas models (originally formulated by physicists to estimate contact rates between molecules) have been developed \citep{yapp1956theory, Hutchinson_Waser_2007}. The gas model has been modified for use with camera traps, which have an angle of detection (the angle within which an animal can be detected)  up to $\pi$ radians \citep{rowcliffe2008estimating}. This angle limitation may not apply to acoustic sensors. Furthermore, animal calls may be directional, and the existing random encounter model (REM) designed for camera trap data does not handle this case.

In this study we create a generalised REM (gREM), as an extension to the camera trap model of \citep{rowcliffe2008estimating}, to estimate absolute density from count data from acoustic detectors, or camera traps, where the sensor angle can vary from 0 to $2\pi$ radians, and the acoustic signal given off from the animal can be directional (we call the width of an animals acoustic call the call angle).  We tested the model using simulations in order to assess the validity of the models and in order to give suggestions for best practice. Specifically, we test that the analytical model can accurately predict density when the assumptions of a homogeneous environment and straight-line animal movement are met. We went on to test the accuracy of the model if the assumptions about animal movement were broken, including non-continuous movement and correlated and random walks. 

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Analytical Model}

We broke the gREM into many different models for different values of the sensor angle and the call angle for the purposes of derivation. The parameter space is broken into quadrants which are named after the compass direction of their quadrant. We have derived the original gas model and model SE2 as an illustration of the general principle. The remaining derivations are included in the supplementary material (Appendix S1).

Our derivations follow the model presented by \citep{rowcliffe2008estimating} which adapts the ideal gas model to model count data from camera trap surveys. This model is derived assuming a stationary sensor with a detection angle $\theta$ less than $\pi$ radians and detection distance $r$ (see Table~\ref{t:paras} for a list of symbols), giving a circular sector within which animals can be detected (detection zone). However, in order to apply this approach more generally, and in particular to acoustic sensors, we need both to relax the constraint on detection angle, and allow for animals with directional calls. We therefore model the animal as having an associated call angle $\alpha$. In general we are aiming to derive models for any detection angle, $ \theta$, between 0 and $2\pi$ and any call angle, $ \alpha$, between 0 and $2\pi$. Although these two parameters vary continuously, we find that there are many discontinuities in the form of the equation describing density as a function of detection rate, depending on the combination of detection angle and call angle. In this section we show the derivation for the basic gas model (which is the simplest of the models) and outline the general process for deriving other models by working through one example.

\subsubsection{Gas Model}

Here we derive the gas model which models a sensor that can detect animals in any direction and animals which can be detected no matter the direction they face ($ \alpha =  2\pi$ and $ \theta =  2\pi$). This is the simplest model and serves to illustrate the general principle behind all the models. We assume that animals are in a homogeneous environment, and move in straight lines of random direction with velocity $v$. We allow that our stationary sensor can detect animals at a distance $r$ and that if an animal moves within this detection zone they are detected with a probability of one, while animals outside the region are never detected.

We then consider relative velocity from the reference frame of the animals so that conceptually, this requires us to imagine that all animals are stationary and randomly distributed in space, while the sensor moves with velocity $v$. If we calculate the area covered by the sensor during the study period we can estimate the number of animals it should encounter. As a circle moving across a plane, the area covered by the sensor per unit time is $2rv$. The number of expected encounters, $z$, for a survey of duration $t$, with an animal density of $D$ is $z = 2rvtD$.
However, in practice we have the opposite situation. We know the number of encounters and want to estimate the density. We do this by simply rearranging to get $D = z/2rvt$.

For different values of $\theta$ and $\alpha$, the only thing that changes is that the area covered per unit time is no longer given by $2rv$. Instead of the sensor having a diameter of $2r$, the sensor has a complex diameter that changes with approach angle. If we call this average diameter the profile $p$, the rest of the derivation is just calculating this value for all values of $\theta$ and $\alpha$. However, there is not one equation that models any combination of these parameters. Instead, different areas of parameter space have different models which must be derived separately. Therefore we have to identify the regions for which the derivation is the same, and then separately derive $p$ for each region. 

Many of these models have the same functional form, and are therefore grouped together as can be seen in figure \ref{f:equalModelResults}, all of the sub models can be seen in Figure 1 in Appendix S1. The upper right  corner of figure \ref{f:equalModelResults} being the gas model as derived above and `REM' is the model from \citep{rowcliffe2008estimating}. 

When the detection angle is smaller than $\pi$ we need to explicitly write functions for the width of the profile for every approach angle. We then use these functions to find the average profile for all approach angles by integrating across all $2\pi$ angles of approach and dividing by $2\pi$. In practice, as the models are all left/right symmetrical we can integrate across $\pi$ angles of approach and divide by $\pi$.

\subsubsection{Example derivation}

To work through one example that contains both $\theta$ and $\alpha$ we will examine model SE2. All other derivations are described in Appendix S1 with computer algebra scripts in Appendix S2, and the R script of the implemented models in Appendix S3.

The focal angle is denoted by $x_i$ and is the angle which we integrate over. The subscript $i$ distinguishes different approach angles. For model SE2 we examine $x_1$ with  $x_1 = \pi/2$ being an approach angle directly towards the sensor (Figure~\ref{f:x1}).

\label{f:xis}
\end{figure}

By rotating anticlockwise, from $x_1  = \pi/2$ the detection zone is $2r$ wide, as shown by the red line in Figure~\ref{f:x1}. However, an animal will only be detected if it approaches the detector so that as it enters the detection region the angle between the direction of approach and the direction towards the sensor is less than $\alpha/2$. The width of the profile within which the animal will be detected is therefore $2r\sin(\alpha/2)$. At $x_1  = \theta/2 + \pi/2 - \alpha/2$ we reach a point where the right hand side of the profile (relative to the approach direction) is not limited by the call angle but is limited by the detection angle instead. From here the profile width is therefore $r\sin( \alpha/2) + r\cos( x_1  - \theta/2)$. Finally, at $x_1  = 5\pi/2 - \theta/2  - \alpha/2$ an animal can again be detected from the right side of the detector; the approach angle is far enough round to see past the `blind spot' of the sensor. In this region, until $x_1  = 3\pi/2$, the width of the profile is again $2r\sin( \alpha/2)$. We have therefore characterised the profile width for $\pi$ radians of rotation (from directly towards the sensor to directly behind the sensor). To find the average profile width for any angle of approach, we integrate these functions over their appropriate intervals of $x_1$ and divide by $\pi$ to give:

\begin{align}
    p &=\frac{1}{\pi} \left(\int\limits_{\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{\alpha}{2}}2 r \sin{\left (\frac{\alpha}{2} \right )}\;\mathrm{d}x_1+\int\limits_{\frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{\alpha}{2}}^{\frac{5 \pi}{2} - \frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{\alpha}{2}}r \sin{\left (\frac{\alpha}{2} \right )} + r \cos{\left (x_1 - \frac{\theta}{2} \right )}\;\mathrm{d}x_1+\int\limits_{\frac{5 \pi}{2} - \frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{\alpha}{2}}^{\frac{3 \pi}{2}}2 r \sin{\left (\frac{\alpha}{2} \right )}\;\mathrm{d}x_1\right) \nonumber  \\
     &= \frac{r}{\pi} \left(\theta \sin{\left (\frac{\alpha}{2} \right )} - \cos{\left (\frac{\alpha}{2} \right )} + \cos{\left (\frac{\alpha}{2} + \theta \right )}\right) \label{e:p321}
\end{align}

Then, as with the gas model, this term is used to calculate density
\begin{equation}
\label{e:gas}
D = z/vtp
\end{equation}
We can also see what causes this model to be discontinuously different to SE3. Examine the profile at $x_1 = 	\theta/2 + \pi/2$ (the profile is perpendicular to the edge of the blind spot.) We see that there is potentially a case where the left side of the profile is $r\sin( \alpha/2)$ while the right side is zero. This profile does not exist if we return to the full $2r\sin( \alpha/2)$ profile before $x_1  = \theta/2 + \pi/2$. Therefore we solve $5\pi/2 - \theta/2 - \alpha/2 <  \theta/2 + \pi/2$. We find that this new profile only exists if $ \alpha < 4\pi - 2 \theta$. This inequality defines the line separating models SE2 and its neighbouring model, SE3.

While specifying the models had to be done by hand, the calculation of the solutions was done using SymPy \citep{sympy} in Python. The models were checked for errors with a number of tests. The models were checked against each other by checking that models which are adjacent in parameter space are equal at the boundary between them (e.g.~\ref{e:p321} is equal to 2r as in the gas model when $\alpha=\pi$ and $\theta=2\pi$). Models that border $ \alpha = 0$ should have $p = 0$ when $ \alpha = 0$ and this was checked for (e.g.~\ref{e:p321} is zero when $\alpha=0$ and $\theta=2\pi$). We checked that all solutions are between 0 and $2r$ and that each integral, divided by the range of angles that it is integrated over is between 0 and $2r$. These tests are included in Appendix S2. 

\subsection{Simulation Model}

In order to validate the gREM we developed a spatially explicit simulation of animal movement. By simulating animal movement with various movement patterns within a continuous space containing sensors we calculated how many animal contacts the sensors would have detected. 

Each simulation consisted of a  \SI{7.5}{\kilo\meter} by \SI{7.5}{\kilo\meter} square (with periodic boundaries) and was populated with a density of \SI{70}{\animals\per\kilo\meter\squared} to match an expected maximum density of mammals in the wild \citep{damuth1981population}, creating a total of 3937 animals per simulation which were placed randomly at the start of the simulation. Animal movement was simulated with a simple movement model, characterised by a random movement distance for each discrete time step, at the end of each step the animal could change direction with a uniform distribution up to a maximum specified angle. The simulation lasted for $N$ steps of duration $T$ during which the animals moved with an average speed, $v$. The distance travelled in each time step, $d$, was sampled from a Normal distribution with mean distance, $\mu_d = vT$,  and standard deviation $\sigma_d = vT/10$. An average speed, $v = $ \SI{40}{\kilo\meter \per \day}, was chosen as this represents the largest day range of terrestrial animals \citep{carbone2005far}, and represents the upper limit of realistic speeds. To reduce computation effort, a single set of 100 simulations was run for a long duration which could be subsampled. 

%We applied the analytical models to these data and compared it to the known input animal density in the simulation. We then tested whether the estimates were accurate (unbiased) and examined how precise they were.

Animals were counted as they moved in and out of the detection zone of stationary detectors in the simulation. Multiple detectors were set up in each simulation with varying detection angles with the results recorded separately. The details of each individual capture event, including the angle between the animals heading and the sensor, were saved from this information the number of capture events can be calculated for a given call angle. The total number of these detections were summed for each set of parameters in the simulation, the gREM was then applied in order to estimate the density in the simulation. The difference between the true input density and density estimated by the gREM were used to evaluate the bias in the analytical models. If the gREM is correct the mean difference between the two values were expected to converge to zero as sample size increases. For each of the 100 simulations we calculate the error (the difference between the known and estimated density) and so we got a distribution of errors which was approximately normal. We constructed boxplots of the estimates error to graphically test for significant differences between the true and estimated densities. 

All the derived models were tested to demonstrate the accuracy and precision of the gREM while the assumptions of the analytical models were met. We selected four example models (models NW1, SW1, NE1, and SE3, where these names refer to Figure 1 in Appendix S1) for demonstrating the accuracy and precision of the gREM with low captures rates, and the accuracy and precision when movement patterns brake the assumptions of the gREM.  We specifically looked at a non-continuous movement, and a range of correlated random walks, both of which would be seen in real field conditions. The four models were chosen as they represent one model from each quadrant of Figure~\ref{f:equalModelResults}. The accuracy and precision of all the derived models in the gREM follow the same pattern as the four that have been shown in the main text. 


\section{Results}

\subsection{Analytical model}

Model results have been derived for each zone with all models except the gas model and REM being newly derived here. However, many models, although derived separately, have the same expression for $p$. Figure~\ref{f:equalModelResults} shows the expression for $p$ in each case. The general equation for density, using the correct expression for $p$ is then substituted into \ref{e:gas}.

Although more thorough checks are performed in Appendix S3, it can be seen that all adjacent expressions in Figure~\ref{f:equalModelResults} are equal when expressions for the boundaries between them are substituted in.

\end{figure}

For each model we compared the estimated densities to the true densities in a simulation. None of the models showed any evidence of any significant differences between the estimated and true density values (Figure~\ref{f:ModelBias}). The precision of the models do vary however. The standard deviation of the error is strongly related to the call and sensor width (Figure~\ref{f:StandardDevaition}), such that larger widths have greater precision. However, even the models with small call and sensor angles have a relativity high level of precision.

The precision of the model is dependent on the number of captures during the survey. In Figure~\ref{f:Captures} we can see that the model precision gets greater as the number of captures increase. As the number of captures reaches about 100 then the coefficient of variation falls below 10\% which could be considered negligible. %The number of captures is highly dependent on the speed of the animals, the size of the detection zone, and the length of the survey, as these values increase the number of captures is also likely to increase. 

\subsubsection{Use of the gREM when animal movement is not consistent with model assumptions}

 Simulating start-stop instead of continuous movement had no effect the accuracy, or the precision, of the estimates (Figure~\ref{f:Perch}) as long as the true overall speed of the animal is known. Relaxing straight line movement to allow random or correlated random walks did not effect the accuracy of the method (Figure~\ref{f:Tort}). We allowed animals to change direction up to a maximum value at the end of each step, picked from a uniform distribution where the maximum angle ranged from 0 to $\pi$, which corresponds to straight line movement and random walk respectively. There is no significant difference in the variance for the change, this could be because of the between the step length of the animal movement, 15 minutes, means that immediate double counting of the same animal is unlikely.  In the case where large directional changes are likely to occur within short periods of time leading to double counting of the same animal within a short period of time may need to be adjusted because of this.

\section{Discussion}


We have developed the gREM such that it can be used to estimate density from acoustic and optical sensors. This has entailed a generalisation of the gas model and the model in \citep{rowcliffe2008estimating} to be applicable to any combination of sensor width and call directionality. We have used simulations to show, as a proof of principle, that these models are accurate and precise.

The gREM is therefore available for the estimation of density of a number of taxa of importance to conservation, zoonotic diseases and ecosystem services. The models provided are suitable for certain groups for which there are currently no, or few, effective methods for density estimation. Any species that would be consistently recorded at least once when within range of a detector would be a suitable subject for the gREM, such as bats \citep{kunz2009methods}, songbirds \citep{buckland2006point}, Cetaceans \citep{marques2009estimating} or forest primates \citep{hassel2008reliable}. Within increasing technological capabilities, this list of species is likely to increase dramatically.

Importantly the methods are noninvasive and do not require human marking or naturally identifying marks (as required for mark-recapture models). This makes them suitable for large, continuous monitoring projects with limited human resources. It also makes them suitable for species that are under pressure, species that cannot naturally be individually recognised or species that are difficult or dangerous to catch.

From our simulations  we believe that this method has the potential produce accurate and precise estimates for many different species, using either camera or acoustic detectors. When choosing detectors a researcher should pick the detector with the largest radius and detection angle possible, but whilst a small capture area may reduce precision there is only a limited impact on the overall precision of the model (Figure~\ref{f:StandardDevaition}). A range of factors will affect the overall precision of the model, like size of detection zone, speed of animal, density of animals and length of survey which are reflected in the number of captures. Increasing the number of captures leads to more precise estimates, for species which more slower, or have occur at lower densities, then the detection zone and length of survey need to be increased to compensate so that at least 100 captures are collected (Figure~\ref{f:Captures}).

Within the simulation we have assumed an equal density across the entire world, however in a field environment the situation would be much more complex, with additional variation coming from local changes in density between camera sites. We also assume perfect knowledge of the average speed of an animal and size of the detection zone, and instant triggering of the camera. All of which may lead to possible bias or decreased precision.    

Although we have used simulations to validate these models, much more robust testing is needed. Although difficult, proper field test validation would be required before the models could be fully trusted. Note, however, that the REM \citep{rowcliffe2008estimating} has been field tested. Both \citet{rowcliffe2008estimating} and \citet{zero2013monitoring} both found that the REM were effective manner of estimating animal densities \citep{rowcliffe2008estimating, zero2013monitoring}. There was some discrepancies between the REM and the census methodologies found by Rovero and Marshall which may have been down to lack of knowledge of wild animal speed, and an underestimate in census results \citep{rovero2009camera}. In some taxa gold standard methods of estimating animal density exist, such as capture mark recapture. Where these gold standard exist, and have been proved to work, a simultaneous gREM study could be completed to test the accuracy under field conditions. An easier way to continue to evaluate the models is to run more extensive simulations which break the assumptions of the analytical models. The main element that cannot be analytically treated is the complex movement of real animals. Therefore testing these methods against true animal traces, or more complex movement models would be useful.


There are a number of positive extensions to the gREM which could be developed in the future. The original gas model was formulated for the case where both subjects, either animal and detector, or animal and animal, are moving \citep{Hutchinson_Waser_2007}. Indeed any of the models with animals that are equally detectable in all directions ($\alpha = 2\pi$) can be trivially expanded for moving by substituting the sum of the average animal velocity and the sensor velocity for $v$ as used here. However, when the animal has a directional call, the extension becomes much less simple. The approach would be to calculate again the mean profile width. However, for each angle of approach, one would have to average the profile width for an animal facing in any direction (i.e. not necessarily moving towards the sensor) weighted by the relative velocity of that direction. There are a number of situations where a moving detector and animal could occur and as such may be advantage to have a method of estimating densities from the data collected, e.g. an acoustic detector based off a boat when studying Cetacea or sea birds \citep{yack2013passive}.

Another interesting, and so far unstudied problem, is edge effects caused by trigger delays (the delay between sensing an animal and attempting to record the encounter) and time expansion acoustic detectors which repeatedly turn on an off during sampling. Both of these have potential biases as animals can move through the detection zone without being detected. The models herein are formulated assuming constant surveillance and so the error quickly becomes negligible. For example, if it takes longer for the recording device to be switched on than the length of some animal calls there could be a systematic underestimation of density.
