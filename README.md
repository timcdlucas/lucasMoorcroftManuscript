STANDARD ARTICLES
Standard papers should describe new methods and how they may be used. We place emphasis on methods that are applicable as broadly as possible.
Structure:
• Our maximum recommended word count for standard papers is 6000-7000 words (including tables, figure captions and references).
• Title page: Provide a concise and informative title (do not include the authorities for any taxonomic names); a short running title (45 characters maximum); the word count (including references, tables and figure legends); a list of all authors' names and addresses; and the full contact details of the corresponding author.
• Abstract (maximum 350 words):
Point 1: set the context and purpose for the work;
Point 2: indicate the approach and methods used;
Point 3: outline the main results;
Point 4: identify the conclusions, the wider implications and the relevance to management or policy.
• Key-words: Provide a maximum of 10 keywords or phrases (avoid overlap with the title).
• Introduction: State the reason for the work, the context and the hypotheses being tested.
• Materials and methods: Include sufficient details for the work to be repeated.
• Results: State the results, drawing attention to important details in tables and figures.
• Discussion: Point out the importance of the results and place them in the context of previous studies and in relation to the application of the work (expanding on the Synthesis and applications section of the Summary). Where appropriate, set out recommendations for management or policy.
• Acknowledgements.
• Data Accessibility: To enable readers to locate archived data, authors should list the database and the respective accession numbers or DOIs for all data from the manuscript that has been made publicly available in this section. E.g:

2.3 Article Formatting


GENERAL

    All manuscripts should be typed in double-spacing with a large margin
    All pages should be numbered consecutively, including those containing acknowledgements, references, tables and figures.
    All lines should be numbered.
    All spelling and typescripts should be in English.
    All manuscripts should ideally be a single Word or LaTeX file, with figures embedded at the end of the text. Please note that we currently cannot accept OpenDocument format submissions.
    All files will be converted to PDF for review. Authors must therefore open each of the PDF files created during submission to check that conversion has not introduced any errors.


FIGURES
Figures should appear above their respective legends, on separate pages, at the end of the paper. Legends should provide enough details for the figures to be understood without reference to the text. Information (e.g. keys) that appears on the figure itself should not be duplicated in the legend. In the full-text online edition of the Journal, figure legends may be truncated in abbreviated links to the full screen version. Therefore, the first 100 characters of any legend should inform the reader of key aspects of the figure.

Figures should be drawn to publication quality and to fit into a single column width (7 cm) wherever possible. Please ensure that axes, tick marks, symbols and labels are large enough to allow reduction to a final size of c. 8 point.

Electronic images and figures should be submitted as TIFF files (for half-tones), EPS files (for vector graphics) or PDF files, if possible. These are standard formats when exporting from graphics packages such as CorelDraw, Excel, Freehand and Illustrator.

Photographs should have good contrast. Where photographs are used together to make one figure, they should be well matched for tonal range. Photographs submitted electronically should be saved at 300 d.p.i. in TIFF or BMP format at the final reproduction size.

For full instructions on preparing your figures, please refer to our Electronic Information for Authors.

Colour photographs or other figures are reproduced online free of charge. This includes the PDF version. Authors are encouraged to make good use of colour wherever possible.

Do not include high-resolution versions of figures at submission; reduce the size and resolution of graphics to give a total file size of less than 1 MB. If a manuscript is accepted, higher quality versions of figures can be submitted at a later stage, such as during a revision.

Authors should retain their electronic manuscript file in case of any difficulties arising during online submission.

TABLES
Units should appear in parentheses after the column or row title. Each table should be on a separate page, numbered and titled, and included at the end of the paper before the figures.

REFERENCES
References in the text should be separated by a semi-colon. Papers with more than three authors should be abbreviated: (Manel et al. 1999). Work with the same first author and date should be coded by letters: (Thompson et al. 1991a,b). References should be listed in chronological order within the text. The references in the list should be in alphabetical order with the journal name in full. The format should be as follows:

-Begon, M., Harper, J.L. & Townsend, C.R. (1996) Ecology: Individuals, Populations and Communities, 3rd edn. Blackwell Science, Oxford.
-Tuyttens, F.A.M. (1999) The consequences of social perturbation caused by badger removal for the control of bovine tuberculosis in cattle: a study of behaviour, population dynamics and epidemiology. PhD thesis, University of Oxford, Oxford.
-McArthur, W.M. (1993) History of landscape development. Reintegrating Fragmented Landscapes (eds R.J. Hobbs & D.A. Saunders), pp. 10-22. Springer Verlag, Berlin.
-Hill, M.O., Roy, D.B., Mountford, J.O. & Bunce, R.G.H. (2000) Extending Ellenberg's indicator values to a new area: an algorithmic approach. Journal of Applied Ecology, 37, 3-15.
-R Development Core Team (2009) R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna. URL http://www.R-project.org [accessed 18 November 2009]

References should be cited as 'in press' only if the paper has been accepted for publication. Work not yet submitted for publication or under review should be cited as 'unpublished data', with the author's initials and surname given; such work should not be included in the Reference section. Any paper cited as 'in press' or under review elsewhere must be uploaded as part of the manuscript submission as a file 'not for review' so that it can be seen by the editors and, if necessary, made available to the referees.

We recommend the use of a tool such as EndNote or Reference Manager for reference management and formatting. EndNote reference styles can be searched for here and Reference Manager reference styles can be searched for here.

CITATIONS FROM THE WORLD WIDE WEB
MEE accepts that authors may sometimes wish to cite information available from the world wide web in similar ways to the citation of published literature. In using this option, authors are asked to ensure that:
• Fully authenticated addresses are included in the reference list, along with titles, years and authors of the sources being cited, and the most recent date the site was accessed;
• The sites or information sources have sufficient longevity and ease of access for others to follow up the citation;
• The information is of a scientific quality at least equal to that of peer-reviewed information available in learned scientific journals;
• Hard literature sources are used in preference where they are available.
It is likely that official web sites from organisations such as learned societies, government bodies or reputable NGOs will most often satisfy quality criteria.

SCIENTIFIC NAMES
Give Latin names in full, together with the naming authority at first mention in the main text. Alternatively, where there are many species, cite a Flora or check-list. Do not give authorities for species cited from published references. Latin names following common names should not be separated by a comma or brackets.

MAKERS' NAMES
Special pieces of equipment should be described such that a reader can trace specifications by writing to the manufacturer; thus: 'Data were collected using a solid-state data logger (CR21X, Campbell Scientific, Utah, USA).' Where commercially available software has been used, details of the supplier should be given in brackets or the reference given in full in the reference list.

UNITS, SYMBOLS AND ABBREVIATIONS
Authors should use the International System of Units (S.I., Systeme International d'Unités; see Quantities, Units and Symbols, 2nd edn (1975) The Royal Society, London). Use 'L' for litre not 'l' to avoid confusion with 'one'. Use the negative index for units, e.g. number of insects g-1 dry wt (also note there is no period for wt). Probability values should be denoted as P. Mathematical expressions should contain symbols not abbreviations. If the paper contains many symbols, they should be defined as early in the text as possible, or within the Materials and Methods.

MATHEMATICAL MATERIAL
Mathematical expressions should be carefully represented. Wherever possible, mathematical equations and symbols should be typed in-line by keyboard entry (using Symbol font for Greek characters, and superscript options where applicable). Do not embed equations or symbols using Equation Editor or Math Type, or equivalents, when simple in-line, keyboard entry is possible. Equation software should be used only for displayed multi-line equations, and equations and symbols that cannot be typed. Make sure that there is no confusion between similar characters like l ('ell') and 1 ('one'). Ensure that expressions are spaced as they should appear. Equations should be identified as eqn 1, eqn 2, etc.

NUMBER CONVERSATIONS
Text: Numbers from one to nine should be spelled out except when used with units (e.g. two eyes, and 2 kg).
Tables: Do not use excessive numbers of digits when writing a decimal number. The level of significance implied by numbers based on experimental measurements should reflect, and not exceed, their precision; only rarely can more than 3 figures be justified.

LaTex
Basic guidelines for uploading a LaTeX formatted manuscript to ScholarOne:
1. Always upload the main LaTeX file first, selecting the file designation of Main Document.
2. Then, upload each file that is related to the main .TEX file and is needed for processing, selecting the file designation of TeX/LaTeX Suppl File.
3. Be sure to upload all style sheets, reference files, and at least one bibliography file, that are part of the document.
4. All image files must be saved and uploaded in .EPS format in order for the file to properly format and convert.
5. If changes are made to the main LaTeX document after all of the related files have been uploaded, all supplementary LaTeX files will have to be removed and re-uploaded.
