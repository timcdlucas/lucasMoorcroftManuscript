### Branches

There are two main branches.
[master](https://github.com/timcdlucas/lucasMoorcroftManuscript/tree/master) is our general use branch and is a mess.
[postPeerReview](https://github.com/timcdlucas/lucasMoorcroftManuscript/tree/postPeerReview) is a tidy branch with just the files needed for the manuscript.


### postPeerReview

`lucas_et_al_mainms_*date*.tex` contains the main manuscript.

`lucas_et_al_mainms_*date*.pdf` is a compiled, unformatted pdf of the manuscript.

`lucas_et_al_tex_suppl_file_2015-01-20.bib` and `lucas_et_al_tex_suppl_file_2015-01-20.bst` are the latex reference and style file.

`imgs/` Contains all the .pdf figures for the paper.


`supplementary-material/` contains:
- `REM-methods.tex`, `lucas_et_al_supplementarymaterial_2015-01-20.tex` and a directory of .tex files,  `latexFiles/`, that make up the text of the supplementary material.
- `lucas_et_al_S3.py` and `lucas_et_al_S4.R` make up the code supplement.
- `imgs/` contains the pdf images needed for the supplementary material. 
- `testSupplementaryRscript.R` contains some unit tests for the functions in `lucas_et_al_S4.R`.



### master

This branch is basically a mess. It follows the same structure as `postPeerReview` but without any of the tidying.
