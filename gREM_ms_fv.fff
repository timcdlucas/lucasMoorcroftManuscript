The filled square and circle represent a sensor and an animal, respectively; $\theta$, sensor detection width (radians); $r$, sensor detection distance; dark grey shaded area, sensor detection zone; $\alpha$, animal signal width (radians). Dashed lines around the filled square and circle represents the maximum extent of $\theta$ and $\alpha$, respectively.}

Symbols within each polygon refer to each gREM submodel named after their compass point, except for Gas and REM which highlight the position of these previously derived models within the gREM. Symbols on the edge of the plot are for submodels where $\alpha, \theta = 2\pi$}

\caption{An overview of the derivation of the average profile $\bar{p}$ for the gREM submodel SE2, where (a) shows the location of the profile $p$ (the line an animal must pass through in order to be captured) in red and the focal angle, $x_1$, for an animal (filled circle), its signal (unfilled sector), and direction of movement (shown as an arrow). The detection zone of the sensor is shown as a filled grey sector with a detection distance of $r$. The vertical black line within the circle shows the direction the sensor is facing. The derivation of $p$ changes as the animal approaches the sensor from different directions (shown in b-d), where (b) is the derivation of $p$ when $x_1$ is in the interval $\lbrack\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{\alpha}{2}\rbrack$, (c)  $p$ when $x_1$ is in the interval $\lbrack\frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{\alpha}{2}, \frac{5 \pi}{2} - \frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{\alpha}{2} \rbrack$ and (d) $p$ when $x_1$ is in the interval $\lbrack\frac{5 \pi}{2} - \frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{\alpha}{2}, \frac{3 \pi}{2}\rbrack$, where $\theta$, sensor detection width; $\alpha$, animal signal width. The resultant equation for $p$ is shown beneath b-d. The average profile $\bar{p}$ is the size of the profile averaged across all approach angles.}
